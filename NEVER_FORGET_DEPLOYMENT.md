## Automated Reminders Set Up

✅ **Git Hook**: You'll see a reminder after every commit  
✅ **Deploy Script**: Run `npm run deploy` for guided deployment  
✅ **Package Scripts**: Easy commands in package.json  

## Hosting Platforms

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
2. Enable auto-deploy on push to main branch
3. Every push will trigger automatic deployment

### Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `build`
4. Enable auto-deploy on push

### Manual Deployment
If using manual deployment:
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Upload the `build/` folder to your hosting provider

## Environment Variables

Don't forget to set these on your hosting platform:
- `REACT_APP_COINGECKO_API_KEY` (if you have one)
- Any other custom environment variables

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
- Fix ESLint warnings: Check console output
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`

### Deployment Not Working?
- Check your hosting platform's build logs
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure your repository is connected correctly
